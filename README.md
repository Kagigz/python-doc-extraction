# Document extraction in python

This sample shows how to extract text and process it, as well as how to get the most frequent words, from Word or Powerpoint documents in python.

## Run the sample

- Download or clone this repository
- Install the required libraries
- Run *main.py*: this outputs the result for the two test documents, *test.docx* and *test.pptx*

## Use your own documents

- Change the paths/file names pointing to your documents in *main.py*
- If you want to output more or less most frequent words (default value is 30), change the number when calling *processDoc*

## Required libraries

Install the required libraries using `pip install LIBRARY_NAME`:
- python-docx
- python-pptx
- nltk
